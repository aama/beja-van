# beja-van
Variety of Beja described in Vanhove2014. 

Beja is a closely related group of language varieties and dialects spoken in the Red Sea coastal and hill regions in Sudan, Eritrea, and Egypt by more than a million individuals. The variety documented here is that of the village of Sinkat (36 49'58E, 18 50'14N), about 60km WSW of Suakin, where Martine Vanhove recorded a corpus of Beja narratives (avaliable at https://cocoon.huma-num.fr/exist/crdo/search2.xql?keyword=beja).
